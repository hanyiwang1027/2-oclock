            There was a foreign land on the other side of the sea that I used to 
            visit as a child. Despite the summer, the ocean foam was cold and gloomy.

            Not too far away from the shore, exotic trees flourish with lorikeets 
            perching the branches — when matured, they launch the tree to the city 
            streets… 
        </p>

            Next to the harbor, occupies a giant monument built out of white pearls 
            and abalone shells. Hundreds of tiny boats gathered around it, with white 
            sails made of snowy feathers. Thousands of seagulls hovered over the 
            vessels — their plumage made of misty clouds.

            In this iridescent land of magic, it is easy to lose one&#39s mind and soul. 
            Things made of other things; life grows out of other lives… Thus, all the 
            children from my visiting group have a “time compass” tied to their wrist, 
            reminding them of “home” — now an illusive idea represented by a single 
            direction, a mere number.
